# Three Station Irrigation System
 The aim of the project is to automate a home garden irrigation system consisting of
 several sprinkler sections and a tent with vegetables, irrigated by a drip line. The project
 assumes the implementation of a system of three devices. The station in the tent is
 intended to measure soil moisture, weather conditions inside and outside the tent, and
 control the valve connected to the tank in which the liquid level will be measured.
 The station at the sprinkler switchboard is responsible for activating any section. Based
 on data from the sensors, a decision is made to start cyclic watering. The home station
 enables the representation of measurement data on the display and manual control of
 valves at the drip line and sprinklers. Alerts from other stations are also be sent to it.
